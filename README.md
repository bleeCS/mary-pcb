# The Idea
I've been trying to come up with a way to leave my mark on the mechanical keyboard community, so I decided to design my own board. I realize good PCB design becomes more difficult as the size of the board is increased. Since this is my first project of this type, my goal is something smaller like a macro pad.

This board is meant to be a companion board for one of the most well-known TKL boards in the keyboard community. The board is a number pad with a little twist (I'm sorry, I couldn't stop myself from including this pun and will make more sense soon). I want the numpad to resemble a standard numpad that you will find on any full size keyboard, but have a function key that enables multiple layers of programmability (via QMK Firmware). There will also be a rotary encoder (ALPS EC11 as it seems to be the most popular and easily attainable for keyboard hobbyists) included on the numpad.

Before I committed to starting this project, I searched for macro pads with this layout and goal of being a companion board, but couldn't really find anything. With this, I decided this could be a good addition to the community.
