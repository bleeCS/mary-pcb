# The Idea
After being a member of the mechanical keyboard community for about a year (not long, I know), I wanted to try to move into the design space. Realizing good PCB design becomes more difficult as the size of the board is increased, the goal for my first project is something smaller like a macro pad.

This board is meant to be a companion board for one of the most well-known TKL boards in the keyboard community. The board is a number pad with a little twist (I'm sorry, I couldn't stop myself from including this pun and will make more sense soon). I want the numpad to resemble a standard numpad that you will find on any full size keyboard, but have a function key that enables multiple layers of programmability (via QMK Firmware). There will also be a rotary encoder (ALPS EC11 as it seems to be the most popular and easily attainable for keyboard hobbyists) included on the numpad.

Before I committed to starting this project, I searched for macro pads with this layout and goal of being a companion board, but couldn't really find anything. So, I decided to move forward with the project.
